            "longDesc": "Optically Modulated Fluorescent Proteins (OMFPs) are unique fluorescent proteins (FP) possessing photo-accessible dark states. The naturally occurring dark state in OMFPs yields strong fluorescence modulation upon long-wavelength-induced dark state depopulation, allowing selective detection at the frequency at which the long wavelength secondary laser is intensity modulated. In this highly collaborative and interdisciplinary research project, we used computer-assisted 3D modeling Python software to guide site-directed mutagenesis, notably at site 65 and 148, yielding several Optically Modulated YFP (OM-YFP) mutants with unique dark state characteristics. \n .......... \n Furthermore, we discovered optically activated delayed fluorescence (OADF) in FPs, which was not reported before in literature. OADF takes place while the near IR secondary coexcitation repumps the emissive S1 level from the long-lived triplet state due to secondary laser-induced, reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), producing additional nanosecond-lived, visible fluorescence that is delayed by many microseconds after the primary excitation has turned off. OADF in YFPs demonstrates boundless potentials to revolutionize cellular imaging. \n ---------- \n Had a first-authored research article published in Journal of Physical Chemistry B.
