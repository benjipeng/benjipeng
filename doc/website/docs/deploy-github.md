## Deploy on Github Pages

Github Pages is great and reliable. Since your fork is public, you can have a gh-pages attached for free.

Your page is going to be on a domain following this pattern `https://{your_github_username}.github.io/react-ultimate-resume/`

`create-react-app` is supporting `gh-pages` out of the box and we made it even easier for you.

Everything is included in dependencies. It's only two step üëç

First :
Add a homepage field in the `package.json` : `"homepage" : "https://{your_github_username}.github.io/react-ultimate-resume/"`

Then : `yarn gh-deploy`

```
yarn run v1.22.4
$ yarn build && gh-pages build -D
$ react-scripts build

The project was built assuming it is hosted at /react-ultimate-resume/.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.
